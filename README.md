The best way to improve my javascript is to design logics like this.
this game is fun especially with friends to determine the winner, the two players have to keep rolling the dice accumulating their scores.
the first amongst the player to score 50 points wins the game.
if a player rolls a 1 the next player gets a turn. if fun and easy to play. happy dicey
